		<h1>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind:</h1>
		<h2>(Author :-Dr. Joseph Murphy)</h2>
		<p>Murphy was born in Ballydehob, County Cork, Ireland, the son of a private boys' school headmaster and raised a Roman Catholic. He joined the Jesuits.  He became a professional pharmacist in New York City (having a degree in chemistry by that time). Here
		he attended the Church of the Healing Christ (part of the Church of Divine Science), where Emmet Fox had become minister in 1931This book can bring to your notice the innate power that the sub-conscious holds. We have some traits which seem like habits, but 
		in reality these are those traits which are directly controlled by the sub-conscious mind,
		vis-Ã -vis your habits or your routine can be changed if you can control and direct your sub-conscious mind positively. To be able to control this 'mind power' and use it to improve the quality of your life is no walk in the park. This is where this book 
		acts as a guide and allows you to decipher the depths of the sub-conscious.In this book, 'The power of your subconscious mind', the author fuses his spiritual wisdom and scientific research to bring to light how the sub-conscious mind can be a major 
		influence on our daily lives. Once you understand your subconscious mind, you can also control or get rid of the various phobias that you may have in turn opening a brand new world of positive energy.<p>
